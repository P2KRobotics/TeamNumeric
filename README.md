# Robot Details
## Hardware Specifications Descriptions
- Fischertechnik Robotics TXT 4.0 Base Set & Robotics Add On: Autonomus Driving.
- Coding Software: ROBO Pro Coding Software
## Driving mechanism
 -  Steering mechanism with 4 wheels
 -  Two wheels at the back connect with one Encoder motor (for forwards and backwards)
  -  Two wheels at the front connect with the servo motor from Steering mechanism (for left and right turn)
  
## Sensors used
- Camera to sense the red and green signals.
- Sonar sensors to aviod hiting the wall and for precise angles with help of the walls and distane reading.

## Camera and Image Processing
ToDo: Image processing algorithm for detecting color
         - Image resolution
         - 
ToDO: Take screenshot of fischer technik software and paster it -> image processing module. Explain how you are using this software to get threshold values

## Sonar sensor
ToDo: How sonar sensor works
ToDo: For what purpose you are using it
ToDo: What problems did you faced while using it

## Algorithm progress
ToDo: Speedometer
         - We learned GUI fro microcontroller
         - We created it for logging the information
         - Put screenshot of it
         - Graphical User Interface
ToDo: How much distance robot moved

## Topics learn in Robotics
ToDo: Computer Vision
ToDo: Sensor Fusion
ToDo: Path Planning

## Build Process
ToDo: Compile and Upload, what is the difference
- How it works with Fischer Technik


## First programs
- Camera sensing the red and green signals.
- Our goal was to subtract the RGB values and if it is bigger the Treshold (50)
- If we wanted to sense red then R_Value-(G_Value+B_Value)>Treshold
- If we wanted to sense green then G_Value-(R_Value+B_Value)>Treshold

# Our Plans

## Qualification Round

We saw that the wall will come till a patikular point so we programmed the robo to move at the boader of the mat.It works but the after for every round the angles 
differs. 
So we used the sonar sensor to detect the wall and to get precise angles.
