# Robot Details
## Hardware Specifications Descriptions
- Fischertechnik Robotics TXT 4.0 Base Set & Robotics Add On: Autonomus Driving.
- Coding Software: ROBO Pro Coding Software
## Driving mechanism
 -  Steering mechanism with 4 wheels
 -  Two wheels at the back connect with one Encoder motor (for forwards and backwards)
  -  Two wheels at the front connect with the servo motor from Steering mechanism (for left and right turn)
  
## Sensors used
- Camera to sense the red and green signals.
- Sonar sensors to aviod hiting the wall and for precise angles with help of the walls and distane reading.

## First programs
- Camera sensing the red and green signals.
- Our goal was to subtract the RGB values and if it is bigger the Treshold (50)
- If we wanted to sense red then R_Value-(G_Value+B_Value)>Treshold
- If we wanted to sense green then G_Value-(R_Value+B_Value)>Treshold
