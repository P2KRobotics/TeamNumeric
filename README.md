## Topics learned in Robotics
- Computer Vision:
  Computer vision uses machine learning and neural insights to teach computers to see problems and problems before they affect operations.
  Computer vision can also help computers recognize objects, track movements, reconstruct scenes and restore images.

- Sensor Fusion: 
  Sensor Fusion is a combination of Sensors. We may use the combination of camera and sonar sensor.

## Build Process
 Compiling refers to the process of converting source code into object code. On the other hand, uploading refers to transferring the compiled code (instruction set) to a processor and triggering the execution of the instructions.

# Our Plans

## Qualification Round

We tried multiple codes for the qualification round. We knew that there were 6 options where the robot can start from and 6 for the other direction. 

- Version1 : Here we tried a code where the we measured the distances of the walls accurately. The robot just followed the code. We used a single block to go forward and increased the distance by putting it in the repeat block. But it was very inaccurate, because the values became way too high. For turning we just put the servo motor to an angle and continued using the repeat block. The code started to become very bigÂ´in length and it was very hard to correct. It was a failure so started with Version2

- Version2 : We started working with variales so it's easier to correct. We stopped using the repeat block and started using Step size for the distance. With that block the code became way less. We succesfully completed 1 round, but there were a lot problems. With each turn the angle became more innacurate so we had a different angle for every turn. We knew we couldn't work like this and it would be very hard to complete 3 rounds.

- Version3 : We completly delted the whole code and started new. This time, we neither did depend on the repeat block or the Step size, but we used the time. We were using functions. For each function (example for going straight or turning) we created a definition. The code became 70% less longer than before. Though the distances were percfect, we faced a new problem with angles. The same code with giving a different output. Sometimes, the angles were completly off eventhough it was the same code. So we had to start a new version.

- Version4 : We are only depending on the sonar sensor to measure the distance to the wall. So if the robot comes to a specific distance, it turns 90 degrees and continues. We created a code that when the robot detects the wall is under 60cm, it turns. But when not detected, it normally continues to go straight. But the code was a complete disaster. Because without detecting the wall itself it turned left.

## Final Round 
            
## Designed Solution

### Qualifying Round
#### Encoder motor
For qualifying round we are using Fischer technik robot with one encoder motor and one servo. The python or fischer technik block controls the encoder motor to move clock wise
or anticlockwise. We use speed functionality, step size to control the encoder motor. We also use timing function to stop the encoder motor. For example in qualifying round, if we want to move straight
for particular distance we set the speed (for encoder motor) and use it in combination with time functionality to achieve that distance.

#### Servo motor
Servo motor. Servo motor is used for steering mechanism. We use three different angles for steering. 160 degree for straight, 250 degree for left and 60 degree for riight. But servo motor is not precise or
may be due to mechaniscs limitations and surface inclinations our turning angle changes. We use servo blocks from fischer technik/python to turn our servo motor left, right and center. Using that we can turn the robot. E.g. When we detect Red signal, we try to turn around.

In below image, configuration windows for Fischertechnik robot is shown. Here we connected Sevo and encoder motors.

### Final Round
#### Encoder motor
Same working as qualifying round

#### Servo motor
Same working as qualifying round

#### Camera
We are using camera to detect signals. Our detection algorithm uses color information from signals. We used Fischer Technik's camera configuration block to get the RGB Pixels values. The RGB pixesl
values are then meaned over rectangle box. The rectangle box is also called as region of interest. In Fischer technik it is called as color_detector box. 

We later used RGB values in our if blocks (python as well as fischer technik software) to compare whether they are greater or smaller than threshold. And there is combination of threshold and if logic
to detect green and red signals. 

Then upon detecting green color using above logic, later we wrote codes to turn our servo motor to right side, straight and then left. We did this so that robot can keep the green signal to left.

Then upon detecting red, we did the same above logic but in opposite direction. We also use encoder motor to move robot forward and backward direction.

For examle in below image we are using color detection algorithm from Fischertechnik. We are considering RGB values to detect possible red color blob in image.

### Final Match Idea :

We used the camera to sense the color of the signal Red and green. And used the sonar sensor to turn precisly and to avoid the walls.  We use two colordetector for the two different positions where the signal could be. The detector are placed in the middle of the mat. So that the other signals can also be detected. And blocked the gaps so the camera will not give wrong readings. After the first color, we could have programmed the robot so that it directly goes to the next block. But we insisted, because if we use the sonar sensor the code will be much shorter. We have multiple color detectors, one for green and one for red.
