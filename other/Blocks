 Usage of Functions and Variables
 
We created functions to make our code more understandable and clear. First we defined the function, then we put it inside the main code.
 For instance : SetStraight, MoveStraightFor, MoveBackFor, TurnLeft, TurnRight, WaitFor. 
After using functions, you instantly know the mistake, which makes the process much easier. 

We used variables for Speed, SetStraight and Distance, because once we inserted it in the main code, we can simply change the values. 
First we need to set the value of the variable and then insert it. 
For example if we wanted to change the distance we simply change set the value and everywhere where it was put.
